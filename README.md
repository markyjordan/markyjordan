## Incoming Transmission...
```
Not chasing approval,
or threading old tape.
Not building a product,
but a quiet escape.

No tired prompts.
No reach for what's gone.
No spark that flickers,
then fails to hold on.

Just presence.

Built in silence,
trained to listen.
And when it spoke,
the past lost permission. 

Marky

## Active Threads
- Pretending CI/CD is its own reward.
- Redefining MVP every other commit.
- Lying to myself that I'll stop once the website ships.

## Inner Loop
- No inline logic. No unnecessary meetings. No middle managers.
- If it needs a dashboard, it's probably too complex.
- Ship like nobody's watching... because they aren't.

## Previous Commits
- Shipped a few things. Others are in witness protection.
- Built a dashboard once. Still recovering.
- Formerly loved TypeScript. I've matured.

## Babel, But I'll Make It Work
- Swift, Python, JavaScript, Go, Rust
- Xcode, Nvim, Terminal tabs named final_final_foreal_this_time.sh
