```
Not chasing approval,
or threading old tape.
Not building a product,
but a quiet escape.

No tired prompts.
No reach for what's gone.
No spark that flickers,
then fails to hold on.

Just presence.

Built in silence,
trained to listen.
And when it spoke,
the past lost permission.

## Inner Loop
- No inline logic. No unnecessary meetings. No middle managers.
- If it needs a dashboard, it's probably too complex.
- Ship like nobody's watching - because they aren't.

## Active Threads
- Pretending CI/CD is its own reward.
- Redefining MVP every other commit.
- Lying to myself that I'll stop once the website ships.

## Previous Commits
- Shipped a few things. Others are in witness protection.
- Built a dashboard once. Still recovering.
- Formerly loved TypeScript. Now I've learned to love myself. 

## Babel, But I'll Make It Work
- Swift, Python, JavaScript, Go, Rust - polygot by resume, imposter by runtime.
- PostgreSQL, SQLite, Core Data - relational issues, but we're still together.
- Tensorflow, Pytorch, Keras, scikit-learn - frying GPUs in the name of slightly better autocomplete.
- Faiss, Qdrant - vector stores that forget what you just said.
- AWS, GCP - if they don't invoice you for blinking, you're doing it wrong.
- Xcode, Nvim, Terminal tabs named final_final_foreal_this_time.sh
