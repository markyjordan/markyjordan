Not building a product,
but a departure.

It won't ask for attention,
but it'll start responding.

Built in silence.
Trained to listen.
And when it speaks,

## Active Threads
- Pretending CI/CD is its own reward.
- Redefining MVP every other commit.

## Inner Loop
- No inline logic. No unnecessary meetings. No middle managers.
- If it needs a dashboard, it's probably too complex.
- Ship like nobody's watching. Because they aren't.
